## Notes

- Always warm up with 5 min brisk walk/jog before intervals/tempos, and cool down after.
- Adjust long runs if soreness lingers >3 days (cut distance by 1â€“2 km).
- Strength training 1â€“2x/week (squats, lunges, planks) will reduce injury risk.
- Rest days are flexible, but ideally place one after long runs.
