So this is it, my first blog post. To keep things fairly light hearted with this one, I'm going to be outlining some of my running times and how I intend on increasing this over time.

Before we get into some of my times and my thoughts around them, I guess it makes sense to provide some preamble around my althletic backgorund, running experience, expectations and goals.

I'll keep my athletic background short, I'm extremely sedintary and have never really participated in sports, other than mandatory high-school PE class.

As of today (Sunday, 7th September 2025), I've been running for roughly 3/4 months consistently, attemping to run 3 times a week however typically falling short at 1 or 2 times per week.

In terms of my expectations and goals, I'm generally jsut trying to be healthier and maintain healthy habbits by being generally healthier. I think long term, maybe something crazy like a half-marathon or maybe even a full one, however I'm far from that point today, but you never know!

I'm going to be gradually increasing my running intensity over time, until I can comfortably run 10km without stopping.

I'll start out of the gate, with my top 5 ~2.45 kilometer times. The reason I'm starting with this, is because I've done that most frequently as a route near my home.

<table>
  <caption>Top 5 run times for ~2.45 km route</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Pace</th>
      <th scope="col">Time</th>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>5:46/km</td>
      <td>13:57</td>
      <td>28/07/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5:57/km</td>
      <td>14:27</td>
      <td>04/08/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5:58/km</td>
      <td>14:36</td>
      <td>03/09/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6:01/km</td>
      <td>14:46</td>
      <td>01/09/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6:09/km</td>
      <td>15:10</td>
      <td>21/07/2025</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So looking at those times, we can see I'm no Usain Bolt but I'm pround of my performance and ability to keep consistent with this route in shorter distances. I'm trying to be consistent, not speedy, I'm hoping that comes with experience.

We've looked at my 2.45 kilometer times, I'd like to outline some of my slightly longer 5 kilometer runs and outline the same details for those:

<table>
  <caption>Top 5 run times for ~5 km route</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Pace</th>
      <th scope="col">Time</th>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>6:21/km</td>
      <td>31:46</td>
      <td>23/07/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6:22/km</td>
      <td>31:48</td>
      <td>06/08/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5:25/km</td>
      <td>32:07</td>
      <td>30/07/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6:39/km</td>
      <td>33:17</td>
      <td>06/09/2025</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6:40/km</td>
      <td>33:18</td>
      <td>17/07/2025</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In review, these times are pretty in-line with what I'd expect based on my 2.45km times. I'm happy with these numbers and think it'll only improve over time.

Lastly, I'd like to outline my 10 kilometer time, I've done this once, literally yesterday and I'm proud I was able to get over this hurdle.

<table>
  <caption>Run times for ~10 km route</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Pace</th>
      <th scope="col">Time</th>
      <th scope="col">Date</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>6:46/km</td>
      <td>1:07:53</td>
      <td>07/09/2025</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

So to sign things off, I know there wasn't much content here, but I'm going to start trying to incorporate the 10km regularly, maybe beginning at once every other week, down to once every week. We'll see how things go.

Thanks for checking in, chao
